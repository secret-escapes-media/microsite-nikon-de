        id: jemaa-el-fna
        content: Marrakech’s main square is a veritable theatre of culture, a bustling centre of centuries-old heritage and  evening entertainment. UNESCO recognise it as a ‘Masterpiece of World Heritage’, a title not given lightly. One step into this frenzied menagerie of storytellers, musicians, snake charmers and acrobats is set to confirm this honorary dedication.

Originally designed by Jacques Majorelle, the French Orientalist, the landscape garden and iconic blue Cubist villa offers a bewitching idyll amongst the medina frenzy. After Majorelle died, Yves Saint-Laurent and partner Pierre Bergé bought and maintained the garden. So loved was it by the designer that his ashes are scattered here. Explore the Islamic Art Museum and Berber Museum in the Art Deco villas to complete your visit.

It’s an inspiring example of Islamic art and architecture, with the inner tomb intricately detailed with mesmerising geometric shapes that glisten with gold. This sacred chamber bleeds out to a larger, and onto a courtyard. Roughly 170 burials accompany the great sultan, ranked in order of importance (with many wives and advisors relegated to the courtyard). The tombs are only accessible through a tiny passageway on the Kasbah mosque, after a following sultan walled up the tombs to hide away his predecessor.

        id: ben-youssef-madrasa
        content: Once the largest Quranic learning centre in North Africa, this centuries-old college is a veritable palace of learning; palatial being the most fitting adjective, as the interiors of the building feature some of the most stunning Islamic architecture anywhere.

      - title: Tangier
        id: tangier
        content: The gateway to Africa is a dizzying mix of culture and tradition. It’s strategic location led to the European powers collectively governing the city for generations. It only recently became fully Moroccan again, creating a unique cultural tapestry unlike anywhere else in the country. The old medina sits alongside French colonial architecture and boulevards with a distinctly European feel. An influx of investment and a history of raucous frivolity has proffered a new moniker for the city, the St Tropez of North Africa.

      - title: Casablanca
        id: casablanca
        content: Dreams of Bergman and Bogart, of romance and French colonial charms, Casablanca is an evocative destination unlike any other in Morocco.

The restaurant scene is irresistible and you can even enjoy famous surfing along the beach. Phew!

      - title: Essaouira
        id: essaouira
        content: The affectionately named ‘windy city of Africa’ was once a bonafide hippy mecca, adored by the likes of Cat Stevens and Jimi Hendrix. Its ‘windy’ credentials make it a tricky place to kick-back on it’s Atlantic beaches, making it less touristy and therefore a more relaxed, authentic slice of Moroccan life. Head for the medina, exploring boutiques and art galleries, or relax in the picturesque port for sunset spotting before exploring the town’s foodie credentials.

      - title: Meknes
        id: meknes
        content: Often overlooked for the bustling metropolis of Fez, Meknes is a slightly quieter yet equally impressive city. The age-old medina is a UNESCO world heritage site, where the souks echo their wares within vast Moorish walls. This was Sultan Moulay Ismael’s Imperial City, evident in the ornate, intricate design of the medina. It perfectly embodies the style of 17th century Maghreb fashions, mixing Islamic patterns with European designs. See the sultan’s tomb in the heart of the medina, before losing yourself in the gargantuan scale of the Bab el-Mansour, affectionately called the best door in the world.

      - title: Moulay Idriss
        id: moulay-idriss
        content: A town seemingly suspended in time, Moulay Idriss is a truly remarkable pilgrimage site. A clutter of stacked square buildings cling to the hill at the base of the Atlas Mountains, a white peak on an otherwise isolated landscape. The town was shut off to non-Muslims until 1912 and it was only until 2005 they could spend the night. Tourism has been slow to settle, preserving an old, peaceful way of life for centuries. Fitting, as this is the final resting place of Moulay Idris Al Akbar, great-grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.

        id: volubilis
        content: This ancient Roman city is the best preserved archaeological site in Morocco. Corinthian columns still pierce the sky, breaking up the vast, arid valley that the city sits in.

      - title: Ouarzazate
        id: ouarzazate
        content: This remote town sits in a startling array of landscapes. It is here that the High Atlas Mountains drop dramatically to meet the start of the Sahara desert. The town itself is a great base for desert or mountain excursions, with a cosmopolitan feel owing to its star quality; Ouarzazate is the Hollywood of Morocco. The ancient ksar Ait ben Haddou has served as a backdrop for countless epics, hosting ancient Egyptian pharaohs, marauding crusaders from the holy lands, gladiators and dragonborn queens. It truly is a vastly impressive blood-red citadel, sat in a landscape of enviable diversity.

      - title: Erg Chebbi
        id: erg-chebbi
        content: A vast collection of powdery sand dunes, Erg Chebbi is a remarkable landscape that positively glistens in an array of colours at twilight. A hotspot for camel treks, desert camping and dune surfing, the bright orange sands encourage a whole host of intrepid adventurers.

      - title: Ouzoud Waterfalls
        id: ouzoud-waterfalls
