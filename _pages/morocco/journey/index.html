    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">After a very early flight from London, we arrived in Marrakech and checked into our Riad in the middle of the city. To take our minds off the searing heat, we headed straight out to explore the markets and start capturing the goings-on of this enigmatic place. The noise, colours, and smells of the souks offered a true assault on the senses; with market stalls selling everything from spices to Moroccan sweets, and leather goods to golden lanterns, we found ourselves surrounded by wonderful photo opportunities everywhere we looked.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">It was important for us to arrive at Ben Youssef Madrasa just before opening time to avoid the crowds. It meant we could also capture the place in the morning light, something Ross suggested as a good idea. Following this we went to La Mamounia hotel to explore their gardens and stunning rooms. These buildings offered an oasis of calm compared to the streets, and shooting in them gave me a chance to try something new by shifting focus and thinking more about patterns, shapes and symmetry.</p>

  - title: Streets
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">I have never experienced anything quite like the frenzy of Marrakech – ‘hustle and bustle’ does not do it justice! As you walk along, locals race past on bikes and mopeds, while donkeys and carts carry their wares through the narrow streets. Taking photos was challenging with only a split second to take the shot, but the hectic medina also gave us the opportunity to capture truly unique moments that vanish in the blink of an eye. Strolling around Marrakech we found incredible pockets of light and dark where we would sit and wait, ready for the right moment…</p>

  - title: Atlas Mountains
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">Keen to get out of the city and explore something different, we set off to the Atlas mountains at the crack of dawn. After about an hour of driving we began to approach the impressive mountain range. The mountains are the home of Berber people, who live in villages built into the side of hills. Coupled with impressive views, we just had to shoot this landscape for ourselves. This was my first foray into landscape photography and trying out the zoom lens, offering a cool new way to use the Nikon.</p>

conclusion:

    <p class="text--lg">My few days in Morocco were just incredible. The country really has it all, from bustling markets to stunning landscapes and beautiful architecture – each of which gave me a chance to learn something new about photography. Working with Ross and using the Nikon D7500, I learnt so much in such a short amount of time – it has really taken my photos to the next level. Before embarking on this adventure I’d never used a D-SLR, yet I’ve come away feeling comfortable in manual mode and ready to go shooting on my own so I can continue to develop with this great camera!</p>

    <p class="text--italic">With any normal day of photography you're going to be doing lots of walking, so a comfortable pair of shoes is necessary. </p>
    <p class="text--italic">After walking around and taking photographs it's really easy to forget to drink, so a bottle of water will stop you from getting dehydrated. I'd also recommend not looking too flashy or carrying anything bar your camera worth too much value. I felt safe in Marrakech but with any city you want to make yourself as less of a target as possible. A handful of small currency can also help persuade someone to allow you a photo.</p>
    <p class="text--italic">I love streets when they give off a sense of tranquility and aren't too crowded. If you can get up before dawn and explore the city, when it's just the odd person and a multitude of stray cats keeping you company, I'm sure you'll be rewarded. Don't be afraid to poke your head into doorways with a big smile and speak to people. The friendlier you are, the more likely people are going to let you take their photo. </p>
    <p class="text--italic">Regarding lenses I mainly shot on the 70-200mm lens as it allowed me to get intimate shots of people in the markets and capture people from a distance in the Atlas Mountains. I'd also recommend the 24-70mm as a good 'all-rounder". If you've got the lenses bring them along as you're never sure what's around the corner.</p>
