    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">New York is simply overwhelming. Although some of us had already been there, we all felt like kids in a candy shop when strolling around the streets of the Big Apple, searching for the perfect moment or spot to capture on camera. There’s so much to photograph; from the subway to the skyline, from graffiti to yellow taxis, every corner of this metropolis has a story to tell.</p>

  - title: The Streets
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">After flying to NYC from different parts of the world - London, Amsterdam, South Africa, Minnesota - we all met in the lobby of our hotel, eager to start exploring the streets of the city that never sleeps.
      <p class="text--lg">Our hotel was just a five-minute walk from the iconic centres of Chinatown and Little Italy, where the unique energy of the city can be found in every street and alleyway. We immediately grabbed our cameras and started shooting the fascinating street life that makes New York such a fascinating place to photograph...</p>

  - title: Across the river
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">An early start of 6am saw us heading for Brooklyn, to catch the famous skyline in the morning light.
      <p class="text--lg">We headed for the instagram-famous park to shoot lower Manhattan, capturing the vast, sprawling skyscrapers of the Financial District. After making sure we had the best shots we could manage, we headed back over the bridge to capture more of New York’s treasured icons. It felt like a whole new discipline compared to all the street shots from the day before...</p>

  - title: City at night
    intro: >
      <p class="text--lg">There’s a reason they call it the city that never sleeps, but you don’t realise how appropriate that nickname is until you’ve experienced how the city changes after dusk – when all the ‘night creatures’ start populating the streets. We loved exploring the different districts, each completely unique, trying to capture their night-vibe.</p>

conclusion:

    <p class="text--lg">My time in NYC was unforgettable. This awe-inspiring city is the perfect set for learning new things about photography. From its crowded streets and the fascinating people, to architecture and inspiring urban landscapes, it gives you the opportunity to use the camera in a variety of ways. I tried my hand at night photography, street photography and landscapes, each easily adapted to with the easy to use D7500. This trip has grown my confidence in handling a D-SLR in manual mode and I will definitely approach shooting my own travels in more creative ways. </p>

    <p class="text--italic">My number one tip when shooting around New York is wear the comfiest shoes you have because you are going to cover some miles! </p>
    <p class="text--italic">I would highly recommend splurging on a great camera bag – one that has several departments that can hold a selection of lenses and that is really comfortable to carry. If you plan on taking long exposure shots or night shots be sure to bring a (lightweight) tripod with you. </p>
    <p class="text--italic">It is quite hard to know exactly what you will be shooting in one day when in NYC as there are opportunities on every street corner, but it is always a good idea to have a general idea of what locations you want to shoot that day. I think it’s a good idea to jot down your plan of action the night before – plan on getting to those locations first thing in the morning and at the end of the day, both to avoid tourists and to get the best light. Planning this way will also give you the time and flexibility to wander the streets during the day to get candid street shots. </p>
    <p class="text--italic">New York is a great place to explore many different sides of photography and I think it’s okay to not know exactly what your end goal for the trip is. Go with an open mind and bring a selection of lenses with you to give you the flexibility of capturing different moments. I’m certain within day two you will have a better idea of the type of shots you want to focus on and it will just come naturally. Have fun and remember... comfy shoes! </p>
