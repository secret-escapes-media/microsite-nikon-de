      <p class="text--lg">After a crack of dawn flight from London, we were eager to start our journey deep into Iceland’s wild landscape.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">We headed straight for Vik’s black volcanic beaches to capture the unique contrasting colours of this mystifying spot. In the same area is the famous Dyrhólaey peninsula – a natural arch in a cliff that juts out to sea. At sunset, this spot comes to life with the vast, dark ocean countering the golden light. When we arrived, the sky was typically grey and the wind was blustering high on the steep cliffs. This added to the drama, as we set about capturing Iceland’s beautifully bleak colour palette.</p>
