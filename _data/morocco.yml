  content: For this photo I zoomed in so that the entire shot is taken up by the gold lanterns, to give the impression that you are there in the shop surrounded by them. The bright colours and intricate patterns made for a multitude of interesting layers and textures.

  photographer: Louis Adams
  content: For this shot I used a low f-stop to bring focus onto the spices in the centre of the image. The unfocused spices in the foreground give the effect that you are stood amongst the spices, while the street in the background sets the scene in which this stall is found, adding context to the picture.

  photographer: Ross Walker
  content: Trying to draw in on one subject can be difficult when in a busy market. To solve this, lower the aperture in order to blur the background and keep your subject the focus of the shot. I chose to shoot this photo at a high shutter speed to keep the birds in focus but in retrospect it could also be interesting to slow the shutter speed in order to gain more blur and show movement in their wings.

  content: I feel you get the best out of people if they're acting naturally. Before I shot this photo we'd had a bit of conversation with this vendor and actually bought some of his sweets. Because we'd already had the friendly dialogue he felt relaxed when we asked for his photo. I then just sat back and tried to make myself discreet in order to get him looking as natural as possible. We were shooting at night but I wanted to get the detail in the sweets so needed to increase my aperture and ISO so it wasn't too dark.

  content: Here you can see a spice seller blowing an unknown ware toward the camera. With a high aperture creating a bokeh in the background, certain bits are picked out and frozen, with others blurred through their motion. It’s a compelling image only possible with burst mode. Using this mode you can select the best of number of images that encapsulates the mood you are trying to create.

  content: There were a few things going on that made this a great shot to take - the symmetry, the arches, the path connecting the foreground and background, and the light.

  content: In this shot, the light from outside draws you out, but the high f-stop ensures that the detail in the shadow isn’t lost. I’ve used the natural symmetry and beauty of the building to capture a nice shot, but unlike the photo above, I did manage to get a human subject in this photo and I think it makes all the difference.

  content: I took this shot to capture both the wonderful patterns on the tiles and the effect of the light shining in between the columns. I was initially waiting for the man to move out of the shot but on reflection I’m glad I took it anyway because it transforms what would have been fairly uninteresting photo into a story of a person seeking shelter from the heat of the sun.

  photographer: Ross Walker
  content: The architecture of the buildings in Marrakech was phenomenal. The intricacy of the tiled floor and stone carvings were important to get in shot. To achieve this, a higher aperture setting would capture more detail. I would have loved to have got a subject in this shot to give it more perspective, but sadly nobody arrived who suited. Patience so often is one of the most valuable assets to your photography skill set.

  content: This photograph draws on the precise symmetry of the building to dramatise the architecture. I moved up and down the passage to find the best place for the photo and made sure my camera was positioned as close to the centre as possible. Trying to avoid having any or few people in this shot also helps maintain the feeling of serenity.

  content: To escape the frantic atmosphere of the market we found the smaller alleyways quite a relief. Exploration is so vital to photography, so if you're not achieving what you want, don't be worried about finding somewhere new. I loved the shadows cast on this man's face and waited for him to turn his head to where I needed it. I shot this on quite a low aperture to blur the background but also keep him and his donkey in focus.

It's not always that tasteful paying, but if you really want the shot, handing over a bit of money can help.

  photographer: Ross Walker
  content: Golden hour is considered by many to be the best time to shoot. It occurs shortly after sunrise or before sunset and gives your photo a certain magic. If you plan a photograph I'd definitely recommend scheduling the shot for the golden hour. I find the sunrise easier as there's usually less people around. For this shot Louis and I crouched down and waited for the right people to arrive. We were shooting on burst mode because lots of the traffic was moving quickly and we didn't want to miss the shot.

The grass was blowing around in the wind so I had to take a few to get it right, but here the grass ends up framing the shot which was a welcome bonus.

Everyone bundled back into the van and we hurried back to the hills where we'd passed some Berber shepherds who were herding in their goats. This woman caught my eye so I attempted framing her with the goats in shot and the mountains in the distance. It's useful to break up a photo using foreground and background. I shot this on a zoom lens as she was quite a long distance away.

I'd recommend stopping. For this photo we were hurtling through the hills in our van when we noticed these boys galloping across the field on their donkey. We luckily stopped and I managed to take this shot. Having the bare hills in the background gives the impression these kids are in the middle of the wilderness.
