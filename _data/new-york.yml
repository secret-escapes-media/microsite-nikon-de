  location: New York

  photographer: Marianna Sgherri
  content: This is one of the very first photos I took in Chinatown. It had rained heavily the night before, so there were puddles everywhere. Vic suggested I use this to my advantage and try and capture street shots reflected in the water. This shot worked nicely, as the little girl is so animated and full of joy.

  location: New York
  coordinates: 40.71496, -73.99965
  photographer: Marianna Sgherri
  content: This is probably my favourite photo from the trip. We ended up in a park in Chinatown, where loads of men met every day to play chess. While looking around this man grabbed my attention. He was sitting on a bench on his own, reading a newspaper with the railing framing him perfectly. I started taking pictures of him when, all of a sudden, he smiled. I’m still wondering what made him chuckle. To give a sense of depth to the picture, I kept the aperture quite wide.

  content: We were wandering around Meatpacking District at night when Vic and I saw this fire station glowing in the dark on the other side of the street. The light was too good to miss! I had to quickly change the settings on the camera though, decreasing ISO, increasing the shutter speed, as we had been shooting night shots.

  content: Should you happen to go to NYC do not miss Wall Street. It’s the ultimate real-life version of Gotham. High, dark buildings, narrow streets, and people literally running from one place to another. In this chaos, there’s so much to photograph! I happened to notice these two men talking animatedly so I decided to find a spot where they wouldn’t notice me as I didn’t want them to stop behaving naturally. It paid off – this shot captures a real, gritty moment between these two characters.

We were actually walking from one location to the next when I was struck by this perfect, colourful backdrop that juxtaposes the two women dressed in black sharing a joke and laughing. I love street photography because you feel as if you’re sharing a stranger’s moment – I found myself laughing with these ladies when I hit the shutter.

  photographer: Victoria Campbell
  content: As Marianna so perfectly put whilst we were there, 'Little Italy is an exaggerated version of everything Italian', and I think this picture captures just that. I wasn’t sure if the man sat at the table was the owner of the restaurant or just a customer who fit so perfectly in with the vibe of this iconic street. I spent a few minutes observing him and was fascinated by his contentment in people watching. I originally imagined just capturing the man by himself but I like the addition of the tourist strolling past him, it felt truer to the moment and the location.

  content: We came across a park, not far from our hotel where every single table was taken over by groups of men and women playing Chinese chess. It can sometimes feel like you are being invasive when taking candid portraits but these guys were so much in their zone they barely noticed our cameras and when they did, they immediately went straight back into their zone, as pictured here.

  location: New York
  coordinates: 40.70608, -73.99686
  photographer: Marianna Sgherri
  content: After chasing sunrise at Brooklyn Park, we headed back towards Manhattan, walking across the most iconic bridge of NYC. It was quite early in the morning, so the path was not as crowded as it usually is. Vic and I had a lot of fun in capturing the structure of the bridge, which offers great symmetry. Half-way through the bridge I noticed there was a quite fascinating contrast between the old bricks of the bridge and the shiny skyscrapers of Manhattan. I was so focused on that contrast that I didn’t even notice I was cropping away the American flag at the top of the bridge. Vic immediately noticed it and helped me better frame the photo.

  photographer: Marianna Sgherri
  content: It was raining heavily, so we decided to go back to Brooklyn to capture the iconic shot of the Manhattan bridge peeping between two red-brick buildings. I like the fact there was a person crossing the street with an umbrella; apart from being right in the middle of the street (which I love the symmetry of), it adds an interesting perspective to the picture. I was so glad that the D7500 was weather sealed, meaning I worried less and shot more.

  content: Whilst these docks are famous for the superb view they offer of the skyline at sunset, we were pretty sure the golden light of dawn reflecting on the skyscrapers was going to be amazing, and it was! The low dawn light allowed us to take long exposure shots too. In this picture I kept my shutter open for a couple of seconds, allowing the camera to capture the movement of the water. The result is that shiny metallic smoothness you can see in the picture – I love it!

  content: The first thing that struck me about Brooklyn Bridge was the many different perspectives it had to offer. We shot from all angles, down low, slightly to the right, to the left and with extended arms up high, each shot looked unique. Having a camera in your hands can give you the ability to portray an object or moment how you want to, in this particular moment I wanted to portray the grandness of the bridge.

  content: It was absolutely pouring with rain when arrived at Dumbo and it caused this amazing reflection on the road (and there were no tourists to block the view!). This particular spot is a really popular location to photograph so I wanted to try and capture it in a slightly different way. I brought my aperture down to f9, got really low down to the ground and placed focus on the middle of the road so that the light stream being caused from the reflection of the rain and the texture of the road became the focus of the image.

  content: This was actually our second attempt at Brooklyn Bridge Park. The first morning we went, we missed sunrise and it was overcast so we didn’t get the results we were looking for. Luckily, the second time there was a golden hue in the sky creating gorgeous shadows and reflections on the skyline. I loved the idea of combining water with the skyline. To get the misty, almost magical effect of the water I set my camera up on the tripod for a long exposure, brought my ISO down to LO1 (the equivalent of ISO 32) so that I could set a very low shutter speed, blurring the movement of the water and the clouds. I also used an ND filter that lengthened my exposure time and softened the reflections. I highly recommend waking up extra early to capture the city at sunrise, there really is no comparison during the day.

I started shooting the tops of the buildings, but wasn’t quite happy with the result. Vic suggested I include the terrace in my picture to give a sense of perspective to the photo. To keep everything in focus, I used a slow aperture.

Despite the moody weather the visibility was good, and I spotted the Statue of Liberty on the horizon. I quite liked the idea of capturing two icons of NYC in one shot and decided to apply the ‘rule of thirds’ Vic had mentioned earlier, shifting the framing so that the Empire State Building is in the left-hand third of the picture.

This allowed me to highlight the contrast of Flat Iron compared to the other buildings that surround it. I took this picture while standing in the middle of the street (of course when cars were stuck at a red light!), as I wanted to frame the building dead-centre.

Taken from the top of the Rockefeller Centre, the Empire State stands alone against the moody sky and conveys exactly the type of individuality that identifies New Yorkers from the rest of the country. I especially love in this picture, if you look very closely you can see the Nikon D850 was able to capture silhouettes in the windows finishing up evening work.
